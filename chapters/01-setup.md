title: Setting Up a Local Server
---

Before I used WordPress for the first time, I didn't know what a server was. I made websites with HTML and CSS, viewed the file in a browser, and everything worked. I never questioned it. 

However, one day I tried to install WordPress, and I wasn't able to get it to work.

##### index.html

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Hello, PHP!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Let's do this!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
