> "Thanks a million for your well-written, easy-to-follow and practical guides. Previously I hated working in WordPress because it always felt a bit like trying to find the right tools in somebody else's kitchen — but now I feel confident opening up an existing theme and understanding how it works." — *David*

> Just a quick message to say how great your tutorial on setting up a WordPress theme is. I normally work in standard HTML, CSS and PHP and wasn't sure how it all worked with WordPress but you explained it in such a clear and relaxed way I'm off and running! — *John*

> This is really useful! A million thanks to you! I have always wanted to learn to make my own theme for WordPress but other tutorials are too complicated and annoying. But after this tutorial, I finally know how to make my own theme. Thanks a lot!

> I've been meaning to tell you that I just landed my first real job as a web developer at a digital agency. Your tutorials on wordpress development were what honestly started my process of diving deeper into front end development, and there's absolutely no way I would be where I'm at now without them.  I hope you know how much of an impact your tutorials have on your readers. — *Tony*

> You’ve opened my eyes to the real power of WordPress. Thanks for taking the time to explain so clearly! And thank you again! — *Keith*

> This is the first tutorial that I was able to comprehend and understand in first read and believe me I have been in this field for over thirty years and I have read lots and lots of tutorials. You have a niche for teaching. You have the ability to explain matters in a very plain and clean way. You make it easy for your readers to understand you and follow your words. — *Zia*

> This is hands down the best WordPress tutorial I've ever seen. Just wanted to send a little gratitude your way! — *Alice*

> You do a wonderful job of keeping things simple by not overcomplicating, and starting from the beginning with things. I needed a refresher of turning a static site into a WordPress site and your article on custom theme development has been great. — *Michael*

> Long story short - I just stayed up almost all night with excitement after reading a number of your WordPress articles due to how well written and understandable they are. I feel like I hit the jackpot and did more work in one night than I have in a year. — *Becci*

> It is rare that I get to see a talk that comes from the author of a #1 search result. In this case it was "*build a wordpress theme*". Go google that and look at the first result — for me it is before the official WP Codex. Turns out theming in WordPress is much more straightforward than I had imagined it to be. One of the biggest questions I think it answered for me is "why would I ever try that?", especially in a world with thousands upon thousands of free and paid themes for site building. The talk is great, but I would highly encourage you to go read her blog and build one yourself! — *McDwayne*
