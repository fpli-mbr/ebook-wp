title: Introduction
---

Several years ago, before I knew any programming, I wanted to create a personal website and blog. Since I knew HTML and CSS, I wanted to use my own design instead of a template on a third-party site like Blogger or LiveJournal.

I thought it would be simple to find a tutorial online covering how to convert a plain HTML design into a dynamic website that could be updated through a back end admin panel. I was wrong. All the resources I found were out-of-date, over-complicated, and seemed to be missing half the steps.

After trial, error, and hundreds of open tabs, I learned how to set up a server, install WordPress, and integrate the functionality WordPress offers to design my own custom, dynamically editable website. Since then, I've worked professionally as a WordPress developer creating full-featured websites for business owners, I've written the most popular WordPress development tutorial on the web, and I've been a speaker at the annual WordPress conference.

In this book, I'll teach you everything you need to know to get up and going with WordPress, at exactly the rate you need to know it, and nothing more or less.

### Prerequisites

WordPress runs on a language called PHP and stores data in a database called MySQL, but no prior knowledge of programming, PHP, or MySQL is necessary to start. You *do* need to know the basics of HTML and CSS — this book is aimed towards developers and developers-to-be. As long as you feel like you can write the HTML structure of a simple website, you know enough to follow along, and you'll learn much more along the way.

### Goals

Throughout this book, we will learn:

- How to set up an local environment for hosting WordPress
- How to install WordPress
- The structure of a WordPress theme
- How to update content on a custom website through WordPress
- How to migrate WordPress to a live server

We will not focus on any specific design, rather on the underlying functionality of a theme. Using this knowledge, you will be able to turn any existing website design into a custom theme or build a new one from scratch.

## What is WordPress?

WordPress is a content management system (CMS) — software used to manage online content. It's also free and open source, meaning the code is freely available and can be used, redistributed, and modified by anyone. Although WordPress began as a blogging platform in 2003, it has evolved into a complete framework for managing full-featured websites. 

A few of the most popular purposes for WordPress are:

- Small business website
- Personal website and blog
- Photography gallery
- E-commerce online shop
- Membership website
- Social network
  
WordPress is incredibly popular because it's free, easy to install, extendable, and comes with built-in search engine optimization. Since a WordPress website can easily be managed by a non-techincal person, developers and freelancers can pass off a website to a client, who will then be able to update the website on their own. 

## WordPress.com or WordPress.org?

The WordPress platform comes in two flavors: the self-hosted variety available on WordPress.org, and the managed, shared hosting platform available on WordPress.com. 

In this book, we will learn how to host our own WordPress site by downloading the free software available on WordPress.org. This will give us complete control and ownership over every aspect of the site, and the ability to make our own theme from scratch.

## Getting Started

Now that we have some background on what WordPress is, why it's so popular, and our goals and prerequisites, we can move on to the first step: setting up a local server environment.
