title: Introduction
---

Some years ago, before I knew any programming at all, I wanted to create a personal website and blog. Since I knew HTML and CSS fairly well, I wanted to use my own design instead of using a template on a third-party site like Blogger or LiveJournal.

I thought it would be relatively simple to find a tutorial online on how to convert a plain HTML design into a dynamic website that could be updated through a back end admin panel; I was wrong. All the resources I found were out-of-date, over-complicated, and seemed to be missing half the steps.

After trial, error, and hundreds of open tabs, I learned how to set up a server, install WordPress, and integrate the functionality WordPress offers to design my own custom, dynamically editable website. Since then, I've worked professionally as a WordPress developer creating full-featured websites for business owners, I've written the one of the most popular WordPress development tutorials on the web, and I've spoken at WordCamp Chicago on this very subject.

In this book, I'll teach you everything you need to know to get up and going with WordPress, at exactly the rate you need to know it, and nothing more or less.

### Prerequisites

WordPress runs on a language called PHP and stores data in a database called MySQL, but no prior knowledge of programming, PHP, or MySQL is necessary to start. You *do* need to know the basics of HTML and CSS — this book is aimed towards developers and developers-to-be. As long as you feel like you can write the HTML structure of a simple website, you know enough to follow along, and you'll learn much more along the way.

### Goals

Throughout this book, we will learn how to set up an environment for hosting WordPress, how to install WordPress, and all the essential concepts of a WordPress theme. We will not focus on any specific design, but on the underlying functionality of a theme. Using this knowledge, you will be able to turn any website design into a custom theme, or build a new one from scratch.

## What is WordPress?

WordPress is a content management system (CMS), which is software that is used to manage online content. Although WordPress began as a blogging platform in 2003, it has evolved into a complete framework for managing full-featured websites. 

WordPress can be anything you need it to be. A few of the most popular purposes for WordPress are:

- Small business website
- Personal website and blog
- E-commerce online shop
- Membership website
