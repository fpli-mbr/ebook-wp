<p><em>The Complete Guide to Building a Custom, Dynamic Website (Without Plugins)</em></p>
<p>You know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can make beautiful websites. Maybe you’ve heard about WordPress, but aren’t entirely sure how to implement it, or why you might need it. Maybe a client asked for WordPress, but you’re not really familiar with it. Maybe you’ve worked with it before, but don’t know how to make your own theme from scratch. Whatever the case, this book is for you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Thanks a million for your well-written, easy-to-follow and practical guides. Previously I hated working in WordPress because it always felt a bit like trying to find the right tools in somebody else’s kitchen — but now I feel confident opening up an existing theme and understanding how it works.” — <em>David</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Just a quick message to say how great your tutorial on setting up a WordPress theme is. I normally work in standard HTML, CSS and PHP and wasn’t sure how it all worked with WordPress but you explained it in such a clear and relaxed way I’m off and running!” — <em>John</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is really useful! A million thanks to you! I have always wanted to learn to make my own theme for WordPress but other tutorials are too complicated and annoying. But after this tutorial, I finally know how to make my own theme. Thanks a lot!”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ve been meaning to tell you that I just landed my first real job as a web developer at a digital agency. Your tutorials on wordpress development were what honestly started my process of diving deeper into front end development, and there’s absolutely no way I would be where I’m at now without them. I hope you know how much of an impact your tutorials have on your readers.” — <em>Tony</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You’ve opened my eyes to the real power of WordPress. Thanks for taking the time to explain so clearly! And thank you again!” — <em>Keith</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is the first tutorial that I was able to comprehend and understand in first read and believe me I have been in this field for over thirty years and I have read lots and lots of tutorials. You have a niche for teaching. You have the ability to explain matters in a very plain and clean way. You make it easy for your readers to understand you and follow your words.” — <em>Zia</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is hands down the best WordPress tutorial I’ve ever seen. Just wanted to send a little gratitude your way!” — <em>Alice</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“You do a wonderful job of keeping things simple by not overcomplicating, and starting from the beginning with things. I needed a refresher of turning a static site into a WordPress site and your article on custom theme development has been great.” — <em>Michael</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“Long story short - I just stayed up almost all night with excitement after reading a number of your WordPress articles due to how well written and understandable they are. I feel like I hit the jackpot and did more work in one night than I have in a year.” — <em>Becci</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is rare that I get to see a talk that comes from the author of a number one search result. In this case it was <em>build a wordpress theme</em>. Go google that and look at the first result — for me it is before the official WP Codex. Turns out theming in WordPress is much more straightforward than I had imagined it to be. The talk is great, but I would highly encourage you to go read her blog and build one yourself!” — <em>McDwayne</em></p>
